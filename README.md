**Option 2: CiviHR site**

CiviHR is a project that Compucorp are currently working on and will need a new site:

The design can be found here:

Assets can be downloaded from here:

https://bitbucket.org/compucorp/civihr-website-design

Please build the front end HTML and CSS structure for the site so that the backend developer can convert this to a functioning site.

The site should be responsive and it is proposed that each “pane” should resize fit the screen that it is displayed on.

Optional: - Use a CSS framework to allow the backend developer to use a CSS variable to quickly and easily change the accent colour across the site.
